IMPORTANT NOTES

- frictional heating in sponge (with increased sponge layer damping)
  drove temperature over 1000K; turned off del2 frictional heating
- also turned off frictional heating for del4 (otherwise get max
  temps of 1000K+)

- trial and error stable time-stepping:

se_nsplit = 8
se_rsplit = 4
se_hypervis_subcycle           = 10
